# Reports Directory

This directory contains markdown reports generated by the Should I Move? application.

## Generated Reports

When you run the application, the coordinator agent will automatically generate a comprehensive markdown report analyzing your potential move. 

### Report Naming Convention

Reports are named using the format:
```
{current_city}_to_{desired_city}_{timestamp}_analysis.md
```

The timestamp uses the format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` to ensure each report is unique and sortable chronologically.

For example:
- `dallas_to_austin_20250106_143022_analysis.md`
- `new_york_to_san_francisco_20250106_152345_analysis.md`

This naming convention prevents overwriting previous reports, allowing you to compare multiple analyses over time.

### Report Structure

Each report includes:

1. **Title**: Should You Move from [Current City] to [Desired City]?
2. **Report Generated**: Date and time when the analysis was performed
3. **Executive Summary**: Quick overview with recommendation and confidence level
4. **Financial Analysis**: Cost of living comparison from the Cost Analyst
5. **Lifestyle & Culture Analysis**: City vibe and livability assessment from the Sentiment Analyst
6. **Migration Insights**: Real experiences from people who made similar moves (from Reddit discussions)
7. **Final Recommendation**: Detailed justification for the recommendation
8. **Key Supporting Factors**: Bulleted list of factors supporting the recommendation
9. **Key Concerns**: Bulleted list of potential risks or concerns
10. **Next Steps**: Actionable steps you can take based on the analysis

## Tool Used

Reports are generated using **Agno's LocalFileSystemTools** toolkit, which provides secure file writing operations with automatic directory management.

Configuration:
- Target directory: `./reports/`
- Default extension: `.md` (markdown)
- Tool function: `write_file`

## Example Usage

The coordinator automatically saves the report after completing the analysis. You'll see a confirmation message when the file is successfully saved.

```
✅ Report saved to: reports/dallas_to_austin_20250106_143022_analysis.md
```

Each run creates a new timestamped report, preserving your analysis history.
