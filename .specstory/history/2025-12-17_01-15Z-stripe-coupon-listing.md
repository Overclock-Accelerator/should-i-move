The user wants to list all coupons from Stripe. I can see that there's an MCP tool available for Stripe operations: `mcp_Stripe_list_coupons`.

Looking at the tool definition:
```
This tool will fetch a list of Coupons from Stripe.

It takes one optional argument:
- limit (int, optional): The number of coupons to return.
```

The tool has an optional `limit` parameter that can range between 1 and 100. Since the user wants to list "all" coupons and hasn't specified a limit, I should probably use a reasonable default or the maximum to get as many as possible. The tool description shows the limit can be between 1 and 100, with default being 10 based on the pattern I see in other similar tools.

Let me call this tool to fetch the coupons.</details></think>
