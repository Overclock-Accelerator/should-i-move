<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking me to look at PostHog and tell them how "zap learning views" have changed over time. PostHog is an analytics platform, and I have access to PostHog MCP tools.

First, I need to:
1. Understand what data is available in PostHog
2. Look for events or metrics related to "zap learning views"
3. Query the data to see how it has changed over time

Let me start by exploring what's available in PostHog. I should:
1. Get the organizations and projects available
2. Look for event definitions that might relate to "zap learning views"
3. Query the data to see trends over time

Let me start by getting the organizations and projects.</details></think>

I'll help you analyze how "zap learning views" have changed over time in PostHog. Let me start by exploring what's available.

*Called tool*: PostHog - query-run: You should use this to answer questions that a user has about their data and for when you want to create a new insight. You can use 'event-definitions-list' to get events to use in the query, and 'event-properties-list' to get properties for those events. It can run a trend, funnel or HogQL query. Where possible, use a trend or funnel rather than a HogQL query, unless you know the HogQL is correct (e.g. it came from a previous insight.).
