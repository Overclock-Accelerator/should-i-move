The user is asking "whoami figma" which appears to be a request to use the Figma whoami tool. This tool returns information about the authenticated user in Figma, which can be useful for validating who is logged in or troubleshooting permission issues.

I should call the mcp_Figma_whoami tool to get information about the authenticated Figma user.</details></think>

I'll check who is authenticated with Figma.
