<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking about integrating their Agno application with AgentOS and AgentOS Control Plane. Let me first understand what they have by looking at their codebase. I can see they have several Python files that appear to be using Agno (01-agno-coordination.py, 02-agno-router.py, 03-agno-cooperation.py).

Let me search for information about AgentOS and AgentOS Control Plane integration with Agno. This seems like something I should look up in the Agno documentation.</details></think>

## Plan

Your Agno applications are already well-structured. To integrate with AgentOS and the AgentOS Control Plane:

1. **Add AgentOS FastAPI runtime** - Wrap your agents/teams in a FastAPI app
2. **Configure AgentOS instance** - Set up session management, knowledge bases, and memory
3. **Connect to Control Plane** - Link your running instance to the web interface for monitoring and management

## Implementation Steps

I'll create a new file that shows how to integrate your existing agents with AgentOS:

+ # AgentOS Integration Setup Guide
+ 
+ This guide shows you how to integrate your &quot;Should I Move?&quot; Agno application with AgentOS and the AgentOS Control Plane for production deployment, monitoring, and management.
+ 
+ ## What is AgentOS?
+ 
+ **AgentOS** is Agno&#39;s production-ready runtime that provides:
+ 
+ - **FastAPI Runtime**: Pre-built REST API for serving your agents
+ - **Control Plane**: Beautiful web interface for managing and monitoring agents
+ - **Session Management**: Track conversation history across interactions
+ - **Memory Persistence**: Store and retrieve memories for personalized interactions
+ - **Knowledge Management**: Upload and manage documents for your agents
+ - **Private by Design**: Runs entirely in your infrastructure
+

+ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Prerequisites
+ 
+ ### 1. Install Dependencies
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ pip install agno[postgres,knowledge]
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL Database
+ 
+ AgentOS requires PostgreSQL for storing sessions, memory, and knowledge vectors.
+ 
+ **Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)**
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Start PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
+ docker run -d \
+   --name agentos-postgres \
+   -e POSTGRES_USER=agno \
+   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agno \
+   -e POSTGRES_DB=agno \
+   -p 5532:5432 \
+   pgvector/pgvector:pg16
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Option B: Using Existing PostgreSQL**
+ 
+ If you have PostgreSQL installed, create a database and enable the pgvector extension:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;sql
+ CREATE DATABASE agno;
+ \c agno
+ CREATE EXTENSION vector;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### 3. Configure Environment Variables
+ 
+ Add to your &#96;.env&#96; file:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # AgentOS Database Configuration
+ AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://agno:agno@localhost:5532/agno
+ 
+ # Your existing API keys
+ OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
+ FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
+ BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Running AgentOS
+ 
+ ### Step 1: Start the AgentOS Server
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash

+   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
+   -d &#39;{
+     &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Compare cost of living between Seattle and Portland&quot;,
+     &quot;stream&quot;: false
+   }&#39;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Run a Team
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ curl -X POST &quot;http://localhost:7777/teams/move-decision-team/runs&quot; \
+   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
+   -d &#39;{
+     &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Should I move from Boston to Denver?&quot;,
+     &quot;stream&quot;: false
+   }&#39;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Create a Session
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ curl -X POST &quot;http://localhost:7777/sessions&quot; \
+   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \

+     &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;cost-analyst&quot;,
+     &quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;user123&quot;
+   }&#39;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Continue a Session
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ curl -X POST &quot;http://localhost:7777/agents/cost-analyst/runs&quot; \
+   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
+   -d &#39;{
+     &quot;message&quot;: &quot;What about taxes?&quot;,
+     &quot;session_id&quot;: &quot;session_abc123&quot;,
+     &quot;stream&quot;: false
+   }&#39;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Advanced Configuration
+ 
+ ### Adding Security Keys
+ 
+ For production, you should secure your AgentOS with bearer-token authentication:
+ 
+ 1. **Generate a security key** in the Control Plane (Organization Settings)
+ 2. **Add to your environment**:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ AGENTOS_API_KEY=your_generated_key
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 3. **Update your AgentOS app**:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ app = create_agentos_app(
+     agents=[...],
+     teams=[...],
+     api_key=os.getenv(&quot;AGENTOS_API_KEY&quot;),
+ )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Custom Knowledge Base
+ 
+ To add more knowledge sources:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ from agno.knowledge.pdf import PDFKnowledgeBase
+ from agno.knowledge.website import WebsiteKnowledgeBase
+ 
+ # PDF knowledge base
+ pdf_knowledge = PDFKnowledgeBase(
+     path=&quot;docs/city_guides&quot;,
+     vector_db=vector_db,
+ )
+ 
+ # Website knowledge base
+ web_knowledge = WebsiteKnowledgeBase(
+     urls=[&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator&quot;],
+     vector_db=vector_db,
+ )
+ 
+ # Add to AgentOS
+ app = create_agentos_app(
+     agents=[...],
+     teams=[...],
+     knowledge=[relocation_knowledge, pdf_knowledge, web_knowledge],
+ )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Multiple Teams
+ 
+ You can add different team configurations:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ # Coordination pattern (sequential)
+ coordination_team = Team(
+     team_id=&quot;coordination-team&quot;,
+     members=[cost_analyst, sentiment_analyst, migration_researcher],
+     delegate_task_to_all_members=False,  # Sequential
+     ...
+ )
+ 
+ # Router pattern (single specialist)
+ router_team = Team(
+     team_id=&quot;router-team&quot;,
+     members=[cost_analyst, sentiment_analyst, migration_researcher],
+     respond_directly=True,  # Router mode
+     ...
+ )
+ 
+ # Cooperation pattern (collaborative)
+ cooperation_team = Team(
+     team_id=&quot;cooperation-team&quot;,
+     members=[cost_analyst, sentiment_analyst, migration_researcher],
+     delegate_task_to_all_members=True,  # Collaborative
+     ...
+ )
+ 
+ app = create_agentos_app(
+     agents=[...],
+     teams=[coordination_team, router_team, cooperation_team],
+ )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Deployment
+ 
+ ### Deploy to Production
+ 
+ For production deployment, you can:
+ 
+ 1. **Deploy to any cloud provider** (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
+ 2. **Use Docker** for containerization
+ 3. **Set up a reverse proxy** (nginx, Caddy) for HTTPS
+ 4. **Connect your production URL** to the Control Plane
+ 
+ Example Docker deployment:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;dockerfile
+ FROM python:3.11-slim
+ 
+ WORKDIR /app
+ 
+ COPY requirements.txt .
+ RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
+ 
+ COPY . .
+ 
+ CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;agentos_integration.py&quot;]
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ docker build -t should-i-move-agentos .
+ docker run -p 7777:7777 --env-file .env should-i-move-agentos
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Environment Variables for Production
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Database (use managed PostgreSQL in production)
+ AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@prod-db.example.com:5432/agno
+ 
+ # API Keys
+ OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
+ FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
+ BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key
+ 
+ # Security
+ AGENTOS_API_KEY=your_generated_key
+ 
+ # Server
+ HOST=0.0.0.0
+ PORT=7777
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Comparison: CLI vs AgentOS
+ 
+ ### Your Current CLI Apps
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Run locally
+ python 01-agno-coordination.py
+ 
+ # Interactive terminal interface
+ # No session persistence
+ # No web UI
+ # No monitoring
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### With AgentOS
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Run as a server
+ python agentos_integration.py
+ 
+ # Beautiful web interface
+ # Session persistence across conversations
+ # Memory management
+ # Knowledge base management
+ # Performance monitoring
+ # API access for integrations
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Benefits of AgentOS Integration
+ 
+ 1. **Production Ready**: FastAPI server ready for deployment
+ 2. **Session Management**: Conversations persist across interactions
+ 3. **Memory**: Agents remember user preferences and past interactions
+ 4. **Knowledge Management**: Easily add/update knowledge without code changes
+ 5. **Monitoring**: Track performance, usage, and errors
+ 6. **Web Interface**: Beautiful UI for non-technical users
+ 7. **API Access**: Integrate with other applications
+ 8. **Private**: All data stays in your infrastructure
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Connection Issues
+ 
+ **Problem**: Can&#39;t connect to Control Plane
+ 
+ **Solution**: 
+ - Ensure your AgentOS server is running (&#96;http://localhost:7777&#96;)
+ - Check firewall settings
+ - Try accessing &#96;http://localhost:7777/docs&#96; directly
+ 
+ ### Database Issues
+ 
+ **Problem**: Database connection errors
+ 
+ **Solution**:
+ - Verify PostgreSQL is running: &#96;docker ps&#96;
+ - Check connection string in &#96;.env&#96;
+ - Ensure pgvector extension is installed
+ 
+ ### Knowledge Base Issues
+ 
+ **Problem**: Knowledge base not appearing
+ 
+ **Solution**:
+ - Ensure knowledge base has &#96;vector_db&#96; configured
+ - Check that documents are in the &#96;data/&#96; directory
+ - Verify embedder API key is set
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ 1. **Explore the Control Plane**: Try all the features (chat, knowledge, sessions, memory)
+ 2. **Add More Knowledge**: Upload city guides, cost of living reports, etc.
+ 3. **Customize Agents**: Adjust instructions and tools based on your needs
+ 4. **Deploy to Production**: Follow the deployment guide above
+ 5. **Integrate with Apps**: Use the REST API to integrate with other applications

+ # Quick Reference: AgentOS vs CLI
+ 
+ ## When to Use What?
+ 
+ ### Use AgentOS (Production) When:
+ - ✅ You want a web interface for non-technical users
+ - ✅ You need session persistence across conversations
+ - ✅ You want to deploy as a service/API
+ - ✅ You need to monitor agent performance
+ - ✅ You want to manage knowledge bases dynamically
+ - ✅ You&#39;re building a product/service
+ 
+ ### Use CLI Mode When:
+ - ✅ You&#39;re doing quick one-off analyses
+ - ✅ You prefer terminal interfaces
+ - ✅ You don&#39;t need session persistence
+ - ✅ You&#39;re testing or developing
+ - ✅ You want minimal setup
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Quick Commands
+ 
+ ### AgentOS (Production)
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Start server
+ bash start-agentos.sh        # Linux/Mac
+ start-agentos.bat            # Windows

+ Web UI:  https://app.agno.com (connect to http://localhost:7777)
+ API:     http://localhost:7777/docs
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### CLI Mode
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Coordination (sequential)
+ python 01-agno-coordination.py
+ 
+ # Cooperation (debate)
+ python 03-agno-cooperation.py

+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxx
+ FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-xxx
+ BRAVE_API_KEY=BSxxx
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Additional for AgentOS
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://agno:agno@localhost:5532/agno
+ AGENTOS_API_KEY=your_key  # Optional, for production security
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### AgentOS Issues
+ 
+ **Can&#39;t connect to Control Plane**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Check server is running
+ curl http://localhost:7777/health
+ 
+ # Check PostgreSQL
+ docker ps | grep agentos-postgres
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Database connection errors**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Restart PostgreSQL
+ docker restart agentos-postgres
+ 
+ # Or start fresh
+ docker rm agentos-postgres
+ bash start-agentos.sh
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### CLI Issues
+ 
+ **Import errors**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Activate venv
+ source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate
+ 
+ # Reinstall
+ pip install -r requirements.txt
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **API key errors**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Check .env file exists
+ cat .env
+ 
+ # Reload environment
+ source .env  # Linux/Mac
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Migration Path
+ 
+ ### From CLI to AgentOS
+ 
+ 1. **Keep your existing CLI scripts** - they still work!
+ 2. **Add AgentOS for production** - &#96;python agentos_integration.py&#96;
+ 3. **Use both** - CLI for testing, AgentOS for users
+ 
+ ### Code Reuse
+ 
+ The &#96;agentos_integration.py&#96; file reuses:
+ - ✅ All agent definitions
+ - ✅ All custom tools
+ - ✅ All Pydantic models
+ - ✅ City database logic
+ 
+ Only adds:
+ - ✅ FastAPI server wrapper
+ - ✅ PostgreSQL storage
+ - ✅ Session management
+ - ✅ Memory persistence
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Next Steps
+ 
+ 1. **Try CLI first** - Get familiar with the agents
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+    python 01-agno-coordination.py
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 2. **Then try AgentOS** - See the web interface
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+    bash start-agentos.sh
+    # Visit https://app.agno.com
+    &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ 3. **Read the docs**
+    - [AGENTOS_SETUP.md](AGENTOS_SETUP.md) - Detailed setup
+    - [Agno Docs](https://docs.agno.com) - Official documentation
+    - [API Reference](https://docs.agno.com/reference-api/overview) - API details

+ ## Architecture Overview
+ 
+ ### AgentOS Flow
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ User&#39;s Browser
+       ↓
+ Control Plane (app.agno.com)
+       ↓ (HTTPS connection)
+ Your AgentOS Server (localhost:7777)
+       ↓
+ ┌─────┴─────┐
+ ↓           ↓
+ PostgreSQL  Agents
+ - Sessions  - Cost Analyst
+ - Memory    - Sentiment Analyst
+ - Knowledge - Migration Researcher
+             - Team Coordinator
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Key Components
+ 
+ 1. **FastAPI Server** (&#96;agentos_integration.py&#96;)
+    - Serves agents via REST API
+    - Handles sessions, memory, knowledge
+    - Runs on port 7777
+ 
+ 2. **PostgreSQL Database**
+    - Stores conversation sessions
+    - Persists agent memories
+    - Vector storage for knowledge base
+    - Runs in Docker on port 5532
+ 
+ 3. **Control Plane** (app.agno.com)
+    - Web UI for managing agents
+    - Connects to your local server
+    - No data leaves your infrastructure
+    - Private by design
+ 
+ 4. **Agents &amp; Teams** (reused from CLI)
+    - Same agents as CLI mode
+    - Same tools and logic
+    - Enhanced with storage &amp; memory
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Comparison: CLI vs AgentOS
+ 
+ | Aspect | CLI Mode | AgentOS Mode |
+ |--------|----------|--------------|
+ | **Interface** | Terminal | Web UI |
+ | **Setup** | Simple | Requires PostgreSQL |
+ | **Sessions** | One-time | Persistent |
+ | **Memory** | None | PostgreSQL |
+ | **Knowledge** | Static files | Dynamic upload |
+ | **Multi-user** | No | Yes |
+ | **API Access** | No | REST API |
+ | **Monitoring** | Console logs | Dashboard |
+ | **Deployment** | Local script | Production server |
+ | **Use Case** | Testing/Dev | Production |
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## What Didn&#39;t Change
+ 
+ ✅ **All your existing code still works!**
+ 
+ - &#96;01-agno-coordination.py&#96; - Still works as before
+ - &#96;02-agno-router.py&#96; - Still works as before  
+ - &#96;03-agno-cooperation.py&#96; - Still works as before
+ - All custom tools (Brave search, NerdWallet scraper)
+ - All Pydantic models
+ - City database
+ - Reports generation
+ 
+ **AgentOS is additive** - it wraps your existing agents in a production-ready server without changing their core functionality.

+               Returns structured cost data
+               ↓
+               Agent analyzes and returns CostAnalysis model
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Session Persistence Flow
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ First Message:
+   User → &quot;Tell me about moving to Austin&quot;
+          ↓
+          Create new session in PostgreSQL
+          session_id = &quot;abc123&quot;
+          ↓
+          Process message
+          ↓
+          Save conversation to session
+ 
+ Second Message (same session):
+   User → &quot;What about the cost of living?&quot;
+          ↓
+          Load session &quot;abc123&quot; from PostgreSQL
+          ↓
+          Agent has context from previous message
+          ↓
+          Process with full conversation history
+          ↓
+          Update session in PostgreSQL
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Memory System Flow
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ During Conversation:
+   Agent learns: &quot;User prefers walkable cities&quot;
+                 ↓
+                 Extract as memory
+                 ↓
+                 Save to agent_memory table
+                 {
+                   &quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;user123&quot;,
+                   &quot;agent_id&quot;: &quot;sentiment-analyst&quot;,
+                   &quot;content&quot;: &quot;User prefers walkable cities&quot;,
+                   &quot;metadata&quot;: {&quot;category&quot;: &quot;preference&quot;}
+                 }
+ 
+ Next Conversation:
+   Agent loads memories for user123
+   ↓
+   &quot;I remember you prefer walkable cities...&quot;
+   ↓
+   Personalized recommendations

+ ## Comparison: CLI vs AgentOS Architecture
+ 
+ ### CLI Architecture (Simple)
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Terminal
+    ↓
+ Python Script
+    ↓
+ Agents → Tools → External APIs
+    ↓
+ Console Output + Markdown File
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Pros:**
+ - Simple, minimal dependencies
+ - Fast to start
+ - Easy to debug
+ 
+ **Cons:**
+ - No persistence
+ - Single user
+ - No API access
+ - No monitoring
+ 
+ ### AgentOS Architecture (Production)
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Browser → Control Plane → FastAPI Server
+                               ↓
+                          PostgreSQL
+                               ↓
+                     Agents → Tools → External APIs
+                               ↓
+                     Web UI + API + Persistence
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Pros:**
+ - Multi-user support
+ - Session persistence
+ - Memory system
+ - Knowledge management
+ - REST API
+ - Monitoring &amp; analytics
+ - Beautiful UI
+ 
+ **Cons:**
+ - More complex setup
+ - Requires PostgreSQL
+ - More dependencies
+ 
+ ## Key Takeaways
+ 
+ 1. **Private by Design**: Your AgentOS runs in your infrastructure, Control Plane just provides the UI
+ 2. **Data Sovereignty**: All data (sessions, memory, knowledge) stays in your PostgreSQL
+ 3. **Scalable**: Can scale from local development to multi-region production
+ 4. **Flexible**: Use CLI for quick tests, AgentOS for production
+ 5. **API-First**: Everything accessible via REST API for integrations

+ ---
+ 
+ ## Quick Start Checklist
+ 
+ ### Step 1: Environment Setup
+ - [ ] Clone or download the repository
+ - [ ] Navigate to project directory
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   cd should-i-move
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Create &#96;.env&#96; file with your API keys
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   # Copy template
+   cp .env.example .env  # If template exists
+   # Or create manually
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Verify &#96;.env&#96; file contains:
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_key_here
+   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your_key_here
+   BRAVE_API_KEY=BSyour_key_here
+   AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://agno:agno@localhost:5532/agno
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Step 2: Test CLI Mode First (Recommended)
+ - [ ] Create virtual environment
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   python -m venv .venv
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Activate virtual environment
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   # Linux/Mac
+   source .venv/bin/activate
+   
+   # Windows
+   .venv\Scripts\activate
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Install CLI dependencies
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   pip install agno openai python-dotenv requests
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Test with coordination mode
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   python 01-agno-coordination.py
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ - [ ] Verify it works:
+   - [ ] Banner displays
+   - [ ] Prompts for city information
+   - [ ] Agents execute successfully
+   - [ ] Report generated in &#96;reports/&#96; folder
+ 
+ ### Step 3: Set Up AgentOS
+ - [ ] Start PostgreSQL with Docker
+   &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+   docker run -d \

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I've successfully integrated your Agno application with AgentOS and the AgentOS Control Plane. Here's what was created:

### **Core Integration Files**

1. **`agentos_integration.py`** - Main AgentOS server
   - FastAPI application wrapping your existing agents
   - PostgreSQL integration for sessions, memory, and knowledge
   - All agents configured with storage and memory
   - Reuses all your existing tools and logic

2. **Quick Start Scripts**
   - `start-agentos.sh` (Linux/Mac)
   - `start-agentos.bat` (Windows)
   - Automated setup: checks dependencies, starts PostgreSQL, installs packages, launches server

3. **`requirements-agentos.txt`** - AgentOS-specific dependencies

### **Documentation**

4. **`AGENTOS_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide
   - Prerequisites and installation
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - API usage examples
   - Deployment guide
   - Troubleshooting

5. **`AGENTOS_SUMMARY.md`** - High-level overview
   - What AgentOS adds
   - When to use CLI vs AgentOS
   - Feature comparison
   - Quick start instructions

6. **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Command reference
   - Quick commands for both modes
   - API examples
   - Common troubleshooting
   - Environment variables

7. **`GETTING_STARTED_CHECKLIST.md`** - Step-by-step checklist
   - Prerequisites verification
   - Setup steps with checkboxes
   - Troubleshooting checklist
   - Success criteria

8. **`docs/agentos-architecture.md`** - Architecture diagrams
   - Visual architecture overview
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Component interactions
   - Deployment architectures

### **Updated Files**

9. **`README.md`** - Updated with AgentOS information
   - Added AgentOS quick start option
   - Updated project structure
   - Links to new documentation

### **How It Works**

**AgentOS provides:**
- 🌐 **Web Interface** - Beautiful UI at app.agno.com
- 💾 **Session Persistence** - Conversations saved across sessions
- 🧠 **Memory System** - Agents remember user preferences
- 📚 **Knowledge Management** - Upload documents dynamically
- 🔌 **REST API** - Integrate with other applications
- 📊 **Monitoring** - Track performance and usage

**Your existing CLI apps still work!** AgentOS is additive - it wraps your agents in a production-ready server without changing their functionality.

### **To Get Started:**

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
bash start-agentos.sh

# Windows
start-agentos.bat
```

Then visit **https://app.agno.com** and connect to `http://localhost:7777`

**Manual Start:**
```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL
docker run -d --name agentos-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=agno -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agno \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=agno \
  -p 5532:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-agentos.txt

# 3. Start server
python agentos_integration.py
```

### **Key Benefits:**

1. **Two deployment options** - CLI for quick tests, AgentOS for production
2. **Same agents, different interfaces** - No code duplication
3. **Private by design** - All data stays in your infrastructure
4. **Production-ready** - FastAPI server, PostgreSQL storage, monitoring
5. **Easy to scale** - Can deploy to any cloud provider

All documentation is comprehensive with examples, troubleshooting guides, and visual diagrams to help you understand and use the system effectively.

✅ .env file found



⚠️  Docker not found. Please install Docker to run PostgreSQL.

   Or update AGENTOS_DB_URL in .env to use an existing PostgreSQL instance.

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is running the start script and it's failing because Docker is not found. They need guidance on either:
1. Installing Docker, or
2. Using an existing PostgreSQL instance

Let me help them with both options and provide clear next steps.</details></think>

---

I see you don't have Docker installed. You have two options to proceed:

## Option 1: Install Docker (Recommended)

### Windows Installation

1. **Download Docker Desktop for Windows:**
   - Visit: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Download the Windows installer
   - Run the installer

2. **After Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Restart your terminal
   # Verify Docker is working
   docker --version
   docker ps
   ```

3. **Then run the start script again:**
   ```bash
   bash start-agentos.sh
   ```

---

## Option 2: Use Existing PostgreSQL (No Docker Needed)

If you have PostgreSQL installed locally or access to a PostgreSQL server, you can skip Docker entirely.

### Steps:

1. **Ensure PostgreSQL has the pgvector extension:**
   ```sql
   -- Connect to your PostgreSQL database
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```

2. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   # Change this line:
   AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://agno:agno@localhost:5532/agno
   
   # To your actual PostgreSQL connection:
   AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database
   ```

3. **Skip Docker and run AgentOS directly:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-agentos.txt
   
   # Start AgentOS
   python agentos_integration.py
   ```

---

## Option 3: Skip AgentOS for Now

If you just want to test the application quickly without setting up a database:

**Use the CLI mode instead:**
```bash
# You already have this working!
python 01-agno-coordination.py

# Or try the other modes:
python 02-agno-router.py
python 03-agno-cooperation.py
```

The CLI modes don't require PostgreSQL or Docker - they work with just your API keys.

---

## My Recommendation

**For first-time testing:** Use **Option 3** (CLI mode) - you can come back to AgentOS later when you're ready for the production features.

**For production/long-term use:** Use **Option 1** (Docker) - it's the easiest way to get PostgreSQL with pgvector running.

**If you already have PostgreSQL:** Use **Option 2** (existing database).

---

## Quick Next Steps

**To try it right now without Docker:**
```bash
# Just run the CLI version
python 01-agno-coordination.py
```

This will give you the full agent functionality (cost analysis, Reddit insights, recommendations) without needing AgentOS or PostgreSQL. The only difference is you won't have the web UI or session persistence.

Which option would you like to pursue?

_**User (2025-11-06 16:33Z)**_

you've created a lot of md files can you reduce these? and then throw them all into a folder calld agentos-reference

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to consolidate the markdown files I created and move them into a folder called `agentos-reference`. Let me see what MD files I created:

1. AGENTOS_SETUP.md - Comprehensive setup guide
2. AGENTOS_SUMMARY.md - High-level overview
3. QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Command reference
4. GETTING_STARTED_CHECKLIST.md - Step-by-step checklist
5. docs/agentos-architecture.md - Architecture diagrams

That's 5 files. I should consolidate these into fewer files. Let me think about what makes sense:

- We need one comprehensive setup/getting started guide
- We can combine the summary, quick reference, and checklist into one file
- The architecture diagrams can stay separate or be part of the main guide

Let me consolidate to 2 files:
1. GETTING_STARTED.md - Combines setup, summary, quick start, and checklist
2. ARCHITECTURE.md - Just the architecture diagrams

Then move them to agentos-reference/ folder and delete the originals.</details></think>

---

Good call! Let me consolidate those MD files into just 2 comprehensive documents and move them to an `agentos-reference` folder.

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="bash" data-tool-name="run_terminal_cmd">
<details><summary>Tool use: **command** • Run command: mkdir -p agentos-reference</summary>

```bash
mkdir -p agentos-reference
```

```
$ mkdir -p agentos-reference
```
</details>
</tool-use>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I'll create two consolidated files: one comprehensive getting started guide and one architecture reference. Then delete the old files.</details></think>

+ AGENTOS_DB_URL=postgresql+psycopg://your_user:your_pass@localhost:5432/agno
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Option 3: Skip AgentOS (Use CLI)
+ If you don&#39;t want to set up PostgreSQL:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Just use the CLI versions
+ python 01-agno-coordination.py
+ python 02-agno-router.py
+ python 03-agno-cooperation.py
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ CLI mode doesn&#39;t require PostgreSQL - works with just API keys!
+ 
+ ---
+

+ 
+ **Error:** &#96;Docker not found. Please install Docker...&#96;
+ 
+ **Solutions:**
+ 1. **Install Docker:** https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
+ 2. **Use existing PostgreSQL:** Update &#96;AGENTOS_DB_URL&#96; in &#96;.env&#96;
+ 3. **Skip AgentOS:** Use CLI mode instead (&#96;python 01-agno-coordination.py&#96;)
+ 
+ #### PostgreSQL Connection Failed
+ 
+ **Error:** &#96;could not connect to server...&#96;
+ 
+ **Check:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Is PostgreSQL running?
+ docker ps | grep agentos-postgres
+ 
+ # Restart if needed
+ docker restart agentos-postgres
+ 
+ # Or start fresh
+ docker rm agentos-postgres
+ docker run -d --name agentos-postgres \
+   -e POSTGRES_USER=agno -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agno \
+   -e POSTGRES_DB=agno -p 5532:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Can&#39;t Connect to Control Plane
+ 
+ **Error:** Connection refused or timeout
+ 
+ **Check:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Is server running?
+ curl http://localhost:7777/health
+ 
+ # Should return: {&quot;status&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;}
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Verify:**
+ - Server is running on port 7777
+ - Using &#96;http://&#96; not &#96;https://&#96; for localhost
+ - Firewall not blocking port 7777
+ 
+ #### Import Errors
+ 
+ **Error:** &#96;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;agno&#39;&#96;
+ 
+ **Fix:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Activate virtual environment
+ source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate
+ 
+ # Reinstall dependencies
+ pip install -r requirements-agentos.txt
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### API Key Errors
+ 
+ **Error:** &#96;OPENAI_API_KEY not set&#96;
+ 
+ **Fix:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Check .env file exists
+ cat .env
+ 
+ # Verify keys are set
+ python -c &quot;import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); print(&#39;OpenAI:&#39;, os.getenv(&#39;OPENAI_API_KEY&#39;)[:10])&quot;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Port Already in Use
+ 
+ **Error:** &#96;Address already in use: 7777&#96;
+ 
+ **Fix:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Find what&#39;s using port 7777
+ # Linux/Mac:
+ lsof -i :7777
+ 
+ # Windows:
+ netstat -ano | findstr :7777
+ 
+ # Kill the process or use different port
+ # Edit agentos_integration.py, change port 7777 to something else
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Database Issues
+ 
+ **Reset PostgreSQL:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ # Stop and remove container
+ docker stop agentos-postgres
+ docker rm agentos-postgres
+ 
+ # Start fresh
+ docker run -d --name agentos-postgres \
+   -e POSTGRES_USER=agno -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agno \
+   -e POSTGRES_DB=agno -p 5532:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **View PostgreSQL Logs:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ docker logs agentos-postgres
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Agent Failures
+ 
+ **Cost Analyst Fails:**
+ - Check Firecrawl API key is valid
+ - Verify internet connection
+ - Check city names are spelled correctly
+ 
+ **Migration Researcher Fails:**
+ - Check Brave API key is valid
+ - Verify API quota (2,000/month free)
+ - Check internet connection
+ 
+ **General Agent Issues:**
+ - Check OpenAI API key is valid
+ - Verify API quota not exceeded
+ - Review server logs for errors
+

+ # In .env
+ AGENTOS_API_KEY=your_secure_key_here
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Update agentos_integration.py:**
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;python
+ app = create_agentos_app(
+     agents=[...],
+     teams=[...],
+     api_key=os.getenv(&quot;AGENTOS_API_KEY&quot;),
+ )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Docker Deployment

+     │
+     ├─ find_best_city_match(&quot;Austin&quot;)
+     │  └─ Returns: &quot;austin-tx&quot;
+     │
+     └─ Build URL: nerdwallet.com/...compare/seattle-wa-vs-austin-tx
+        ↓
+        Firecrawl scrapes page
+        ↓
+        Returns: Structured cost data
+        ↓
+        Agent analyzes → CostAnalysis model
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Session Persistence
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ FIRST MESSAGE:
+ User: &quot;Tell me about Austin&quot;
+     ↓
+ Create session_id = &quot;abc123&quot;
+ Save to agent_sessions table
+     ↓
+ Response sent
+ 
+ SECOND MESSAGE:
+ User: &quot;What about cost of living?&quot;
+     ↓
+ Load session &quot;abc123&quot; from database
+     ↓
+ Agent has full context from previous message
+     ↓
+ Process with conversation history
+     ↓
+ Update session in database
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Memory System
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ DURING CONVERSATION:
+ Agent observes: &quot;User prefers walkable cities&quot;
+     ↓
+ Extract as memory
+     ↓
+ INSERT INTO agent_memory (
+     user_id: &quot;user123&quot;,
+     agent_id: &quot;sentiment-analyst&quot;,
+     content: &quot;User prefers walkable cities&quot;,
+     metadata: {&quot;category&quot;: &quot;preference&quot;}
+ )
+ 
+ NEXT CONVERSATION:
+ Agent loads memories for user123
+     ↓
+ &quot;I remember you prefer walkable cities...&quot;
+     ↓
+ Personalized recommendation

+ ## Comparison: CLI vs AgentOS
+ 
+ ### CLI Architecture
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Terminal
+    ↓
+ Python Script (*.py)
+    ↓
+ Agents
+    ├─ Cost Analyst
+    ├─ Sentiment Analyst
+    └─ Migration Researcher
+    ↓
+ Tools → External APIs
+    ├─ Firecrawl (NerdWallet)
+    └─ Brave Search (Reddit)
+    ↓
+ Console Output
+    └─ Markdown Report (reports/*.md)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Characteristics:**
+ - ✅ Simple: No database, no server
+ - ✅ Fast: Direct execution
+ - ❌ No persistence: One-time run
+ - ❌ Single user only
+ - ❌ No API access
+ 
+ ### AgentOS Architecture
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Browser → Control Plane → FastAPI Server
+                               ↓
+                          PostgreSQL
+                               ↓
+                            Agents
+                               ↓
+                        Tools → APIs
+                               ↓
+                     Web UI + API Response
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **Characteristics:**
+ - ✅ Multi-user: Concurrent sessions
+ - ✅ Persistent: Sessions + memory
+ - ✅ API: REST endpoints
+ - ✅ Monitoring: Dashboard + metrics
+ - ❌ Complex: Requires database
+ - ❌ Setup: More dependencies

+ 
+ ## Data Flow Patterns
+ 
+ ### Pattern 1: Stateless Request (No Session)
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Request → AgentOS → Process → Response
+              ↓
+         No persistence
+         Fresh context
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Pattern 2: Stateful Session
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Request → Load Session → Add to History → Process → Save Session → Response
+              ↓              ↓                           ↓
+         PostgreSQL    Conversation          agent_sessions table
+                         Context
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Pattern 3: Memory-Enhanced
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Request → Load Session + Memories → Process with Context → Save Updates
+              ↓              ↓                                    ↓
+         agent_sessions  agent_memory                 Both tables updated
+         
+ Agent knows:
+ - Previous conversations (session)
+ - User preferences (memories)
+ - Historical patterns (memories)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## Scaling Considerations
+ 
+ ### Vertical Scaling
+ - Increase server CPU/RAM
+ - Larger PostgreSQL instance
+ - More agent workers
+ 
+ ### Horizontal Scaling
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
+ │       Load Balancer             │
+ └──┬───────┬───────┬──────────┬──┘
+    │       │       │          │

+     └────────────────────┘
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Performance Optimization
+ - Connection pooling
+ - Query optimization
+ - Vector index tuning (pgvector)
+ - Caching layer (Redis)
+ - Async processing
+ 
+ ## Key Design Decisions
+ 
+ 1. **Private by Design**
+    - Control Plane doesn&#39;t store data
+    - All data in your PostgreSQL
+    - Direct browser ↔ server connection
+ 
+ 2. **Agent Reusability**
+    - Same agents work in CLI and AgentOS
+    - No code duplication
+    - Easy maintenance
+ 
+ 3. **Session-First**
+    - Every conversation can be a session
+    - Optional: anonymous sessions
+    - User-scoped memories
+ 
+ 4. **Tool Flexibility**
+    - Custom tools (Brave, NerdWallet)
+    - Easy to add new tools
+    - Tools work in both modes
+ 
+ 5. **Standard Tech Stack**
+    - FastAPI (industry standard)
+    - PostgreSQL (proven, reliable)
+    - OpenAI (standardized models)

Perfect! Now let me create a simple summary of what I've done for the user.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've consolidated all the AgentOS documentation. Here's what changed:

## Summary

**Reduced from 5 files to 2 comprehensive guides:**

### ✅ Deleted (consolidated)
- ❌ `AGENTOS_SETUP.md`
- ❌ `AGENTOS_SUMMARY.md`
- ❌ `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- ❌ `GETTING_STARTED_CHECKLIST.md`
- ❌ `docs/agentos-architecture.md`

### ✅ Created in `agentos-reference/` folder
- ✅ **`GETTING_STARTED.md`** - Complete guide combining:
  - Setup instructions
  - Quick start options
  - CLI vs AgentOS comparison
  - API reference
  - Troubleshooting
  - Production deployment

- ✅ **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Technical reference with:
  - System diagrams
  - Request flow
  - Database schema
  - Deployment architectures
  - Scaling considerations

- ✅ **`README.md`** - Navigation guide for the folder

### ✅ Updated
- Main `README.md` now points to the new documentation location

## New Structure

```
agentos-reference/
├── README.md              # Quick navigation guide
├── GETTING_STARTED.md     # Everything you need to get started
└── ARCHITECTURE.md        # Technical deep dive
```

All documentation is now organized in one place, easier to find, and consolidated to avoid duplication. The main README has been updated with the new paths.

**To get started with AgentOS:**
```bash
# Quick start
bash start-agentos.sh

# Or read the guide
cat agentos-reference/GETTING_STARTED.md
```
